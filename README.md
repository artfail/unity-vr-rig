# unity-vr-rig
This is a basic template for getting started with VR in Unity. It is a very simple rig setup to use URP with Vulcan and export to Quest and Vive with all the settings set to their recommended configurations... At least to the best of my knowledge. This is meant to be a jumping off point for anyone struggling to just get a VR project to build. Suggestions welcome.
